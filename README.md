# Generative-AI-Framework-for-Text-Image-and-Embedding-Analysis
**Project Details**
- **Title:** **"Generative AI Framework for Text, Image, and Embedding Analysis"**
- **Objective:**
   To build an advanced generative AI framework leveraging Google's Gemini API for creating dynamic content, managing 
   multi-turn conversations, generating embeddings, and exploring AI-powered text and image generation.
- **Project Description:**
  This project integrates Google's Gemini API to explore generative AI capabilities across text, image, and 
  embeddings. It features multi-turn conversational AI, text-to-image capabilities, embedding generation, and safety 
  settings customization. By deploying Google's latest generative models, the framework supports tasks such as 
  semantic analysis, dynamic content generation, and contextual AI-powered conversations.
- **Key Features**
   - **Text Generation:** Create meaningful content for blogs, questions, or tasks using generative models.
   - **Image Processing:** Enhance and interpret images with text descriptions and metadata generation.
   - **Multi-turn Conversations:** Enable interactive, context-aware dialogues.
   - **Embeddings Generation:** Generate vector embeddings for semantic content analysis.
   - **Safety Customization:** Experiment with adjustable safety settings for content moderation.
   - **Token Counting:** Efficient token utilization for better content generation management.
   - **Advanced Use Cases:** Extend use to multiturn chatbots, semantic analysis, and real-time AI-powered applications.
**Technologies**
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **Core Libraries:**
     - google.generativeai SDK
     - PIL for image handling
- **Generative Models:**
   - Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental
